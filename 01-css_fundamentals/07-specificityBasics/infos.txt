SPECIFITY...

Specificity in CSS is all about how specific our selectors are.
THE MORE SPECIFIC THEY ARE, THE HIGHER PRIORITY THEY HAVE!

From the selector's we've seen so far...
lowest to highest

- element selector
- class selector
- id selector

This is one of the reasons many class naming conventions only use classes.

If you understand specificity, you can get away with other ways of approaching thins, but sometimes it complicated matters in the long run for nothing.

General rules get put on element selectors
  (body, h1, p) low specificity

Everything else gets a class
