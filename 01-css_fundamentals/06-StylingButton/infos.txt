Tips & Tricks
For something that looks like a button

1- Put the class directly on your link. Otherwise it's only the text that is the link and not the whole button.

2- Always use padding to create size of the button, and not width and height.

3- The padding left and right needs to be a bigger number than the padding on the top and bottom.

4- In general, use a 1:2.5 ratio for the top and the sides, but it really depends on the button, so don't lock yourself in.
